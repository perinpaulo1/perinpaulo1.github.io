										<h2><a href="#">Dell<br />
										Senior Data Engineering - Global Remote</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p> <a href="images/data_modeling.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="external" class="image left"><img src="images/data_modeling.jpeg" alt="" /></a> My last job was in Data Engineering, working with data modeling and data enablement for Thoughtspot (AI data viz tool). In this position, I developed several models for the business. The business users should rise a ticket with the desire for a specific dataset, by example the combined costs of a line of business. For the tickets like that, it was required to comprehend the business need, and also investigate which tables contain the desirable data. In some cases would request to build views or even connect to different sources to create an optimized dataframe.In those cases it was necessary to go to python and explore the possibilities with airflow. Once with the proper data then came the fun part of modeling,  with the fact tables, dimension tables, joins, group, and creating a data frame that would answer what was required. </p>

									<p> <a href="images/dashboard_image.png" target="_blank" rel="external" class="image left"><img src="images/dashboard_image.png" alt="" /></a> When I become an Analyst at Dell, I had the pleasure of meeting extraordinary people that gave me the opportunity to work in one of the most challeging projects at the Traceability of Global Operations. After 6 months I developed a solution that provided me recognitions and the Customer Rockstar Award by Dell's VP. Before the project there was no visibility if a part number was capture at facility level, the impact of that could be huge. None has done it before because the data was confused, there was no clear path, it was necessary expertise in data and time to work exclusively on that. I digged deep in the data in several datasources to create a data model that would track all the part numbers using SQL, Python and Airflow. The end result I displayed in a Power BI report with a easily user interface where the business user could identify if there was an issue in any Dell's factories, and what was the issue if it was that a factory was not scanning it or if there were any database inside Dells was facing issue to send the data to the data lake.  </p>
